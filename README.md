# AirQ

>"Every human inhales 14 kg of air each day, while drinking just 2 kg of water and eating 1.5 kg of food. Air is therefore an essential >component for life, and most citizens are strongly preoccupied with its quality. With each breath, we inhale necessary oxygen, but also >small amounts of potentially harmful gases and small particles. These constituents directly affect our health, even if we might not be >aware of it. Research shows that adverse health effects do not only result from acute events but also from chronic exposure, reducing >human life expectancy by more than eight months on average and by more than two years in the most polluted cities and regions worldwide (COPERNICUS/ESA)."
